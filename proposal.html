    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <hr />
    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My website will be about fishing for giant bluefin tuna off the coast of
        New England.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The website will be instructional with the purpose of teaching anglers
        how to get started in the fishery.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My target audience is saltwater anglers in New England who are not
        experienced targeting bluefin tuna but want to try it out.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What Content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The homepage will be an overview of the bluefin tuna fishery. It will
        include some basic information about the fish itself, how to target them
        and the many reasons that people choose to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first page will contain detailed information of the bluefin tuna and
        general information on locations and time of year. Information such as
        the fish's size, feeding habits, migration patterns and where and when
        to find them will be on this page.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second page will discuss the laws and regulations of the bluefin
        tuna fishery. It will cover the different licenses to choose from and
        rules that must be followed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The third page will provide information on the equipment and gear needed
        to target this species. Everything from safetey gear needed on your boat
        to specific hooks and fishing line needed will be on this page. There
        are a lot of aspects to this topic and it might require more than one
        page.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fourth page will go over how to actually fish for bluefin tuna:
        different fishing techniques and how to execute them successfully.
      </li>
    </ul>
