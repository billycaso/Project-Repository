        In the second half of the 20th century, the bluefin tuna started gaining
        a lot of popularity due to its exceptional food quality, especially in
        Japan. This rapid increase in demand for the fish led to a lot of over
        fishing especially of the Atlantic species. According to the ICUN, the
        Atlantic bluefin tuna is considered an endangered species. To make sure
        the bluefin tuna stocks increase to safe levels again, the National
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has put many regulations
        in place around fishing for the species in the United States. These
        regulations can differ based on the type of fishing license you have.

      <h3>Licenses</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        There are three types of licenses you can buy for bluefin tuna fishing.
        These licenses are provided by NOAA and are different from a normal
        recreational fishing license that you buy from the state fish and
        wildlife department. The licenses provided by NOAA for tuna fishing are
        called Highly Migratory Species (HMS) permits, and they cover fishing
        for different species of tuna as well as billfishes and sharks. These
        permits can be bought at NOAA's
        <a href="https://hmspermits.noaa.gov/initialApp"> permit shop</a>. The
        three main licenses for bluefin tuna fishing are the angling category,
        the charter/headboat category, and the general category. The angling
        category license is for recreational fishermen. The charter/headboat
        category license is for fishing charter captains. The general category
        license is for commercial fishermen. All of the licenses cost $26.00. If
        this is your first time fishing for bluefin tuna, you should definitely
        purchase the HMS angling category license.

      <h3>Bag Limits</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        Depending on the license, there are different rules for the amount of
        fish you are allowed to keep per day as well as he size of the fish you
        keep. For the HMS angling category license, you are allowed to keep 2
        bluefin tuna per day as long as the fish are between 27" and 47". You
        are only allowed to keep one fish per day if it is between 47" and 73".
        Any fish that is less than 27" or greater than 73" is not allowed to be
        kept and must be released with this license. For the HMS general
        category license, only one fish can be kept per day which must be at
        least 73" in length. For the HMS charter/headboat category license, the
        charter captain has the option to choose to follow the rules of the
        angling category or general category on a given day and follow the rules
        of that category only. Measuring the length of tunas is different from
        many other species. Tunas must be measured from the tip of the jaw to
        the fork in the tail. The curve of the tuna's body is included in this
        measurement.
