      <h1>Bluefin Tuna Fishing Regulations</h1>
      <img src="project/images/noaa.png" alt="noaa" title="NOAA Logo" width="200" />
      <p>
        In the second half of the 20th century, the bluefin tuna started gaining
        a lot of popularity due to its exceptional food quality, especially in
        Japan. This rapid increase in demand for the fish led to a lot of over
        fishing especially of the Atlantic species. According to the ICUN, the
        Atlantic bluefin tuna is considered an endangered species. To make sure
        the bluefin tuna stocks increase to safe levels again, the National
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has put many regulations
        in place around fishing for the species in the United States. These
        regulations can differ based on the type of fishing license you have.
      </p>
      <h3>Licenses</h3>
      <p>
        There are three types of licenses you can buy for bluefin tuna fishing.
        These licenses are provided by NOAA and are different from a normal
        recreational fishing license that you buy from the state fish and
        wildlife department. The licenses provided by NOAA for tuna fishing are
        called Highly Migratory Species (HMS) permits, and they cover fishing
        for different species of tuna as well as billfishes and sharks. These
        permits can be bought at NOAA's
        <a href="https://hmspermits.noaa.gov/initialApp"> permit shop</a>. The
        three main licenses for bluefin tuna fishing are the angling category,
        the charter/headboat category, and the general category. The angling
        category license is for recreational fishermen. The charter/headboat
        category license is for fishing charter captains. The general category
        license is for commercial fishermen. All of the licenses cost $26.00. If
        this is your first time fishing for bluefin tuna, you should definitely
        purchase the HMS angling category license.
      </p>
      <h3>Bag Limits</h3>

        title="How to Measure a Tuna"
        width="500"
      />
      <p>
        Depending on the license, there are different rules for the amount of
        fish you are allowed to keep per day as well as he size of the fish you
        keep. Keeping more fish than allowed or the wrong sized fish can result
        in fines of up to $10,000 issued by NOAA. For the HMS angling category
        license, you are allowed to keep 2 bluefin tuna per day as long as the
        fish are between 27" and 47". You are only allowed to keep one fish per
        day if it is between 47" and 73". Any fish that is less than 27" or
        greater than 73" is not allowed to be kept and must be released with
        this license. For the HMS general category license, only one fish can be
        kept per day which must be at least 73" in length. For the HMS
        charter/headboat category license, the charter captain has the option to
        choose to follow the rules of the angling category or general category
        on a given day and follow the rules of that category only. Measuring the
        length of tunas is different from many other species. Tunas must be
        measured from the tip of the jaw to the fork in the tail. The curve of
        the tuna's body is included in this measurement.
      </p>
      <h3>Quotas</h3>
      <p>
        For commercial fishing, the bluefin tuna season is dictated by quotas
        set by NOAA. Every year, the bluefin tuna season opens on June 1, and
        will eventually close once a ceertain cumulative weight of bluefin tuna
        have been caught and sold. This initial quota is usually reached by some
        time in the middle of August. NOAA will often then set new single month
        quotas for September through December. To read news updates about these
        quotas and other bluefin tuna fishing regulations, visit the
        <a href="https://hmspermits.noaa.gov/news">News page</a> on the HMS
        permit shop website.
      </p>
      <h3>Catch Reporting</h3>
      <p>
        If you are fishing for bluefin tuna, whether that be recreationally or
        comercially, NOAA requires that you report evry fish you catch within 24
        hours of catching the fish. You can report your catch at
        <a href="https://hmspermits.noaa.gov/catchReports"
          >NOAA's catch reporting page</a
        >. Information such as the size of the fish and where it was caught must
        be reported. This is one of the ways NOAA collects data in order to
        manages the fishery and implement new policies and regulations.
