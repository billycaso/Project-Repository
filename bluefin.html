      <h1>About Atlantic Bluefin Tuna</h1>
      <img

        alt="bluefin"
        title="Atlantic Bluefin Tuna"
        width="400"
      />
      <p>
        Among the species of bluefin tuna, there are three different stocks that
        are defined geographically. These three stocks are Atlantic, Pacific and
        Southern. The Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) is divided into two
        subcategories as well: Eastern Atlantic and Western Atlantic. The
        difference between these two stocks and whether or not they cross paths
        during migration is still being researched today. This site will focus
        only on the Western stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna as this is the fish
        that swims in the waters off of New England.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Atlantic bluefin tuna is by far the largest of the three species of
        bluefin tuna. Mature adults average around 7-8 feet long and weight
        around 500lbs. The IGFA world record Atlantic bluefin, which was caught
        off of Nova Scotia, weighed in at 1,497lbs and was 12 feet long.
        Further, it is accepted that this species can grow up to a staggering
        2,000lbs, however an individual this size has never been recorded. In
        addition to its incredible size, the Atlantic bluefin is also very
        strong and fast. This species has been recorded swimming in short bursts
        of 46 mph. The Atlantic bluefin, like all other tuna species, is also
        warm blooded. This allows these fish to seek food in the cold waters of
        the North Atlantic.

      <h3>Where</h3>
      <img
        src="project/images/stellwagen.png"
        alt="stellwagen"
        title="Stellwagen Bank Map"
        width="300"
      />
      <p>
        While this site is for saltwater anglers all over New England, it will
        focus on fishing locations most accessible from Massachusetts. Easily
        the most popular spot to target Atlantic bluefin, and arguably one of
        the most well known fishing spots around the world, is Stellwagen Bank.
        Stellwagen Bank is an underwater plateau situated at the mouth of
        Massachusetts Bay. It lies about 25 miles east of Boston and about 5
        miles north of Provincetown. It stretches 19 miles north to south, and
        six miles east to west at its widest part near the southern end. On
        average, the bank is about 100 to 120 feet deep while the surrounding
        waters are at least 300 feet deep. The steep sides of the plateau cause
        deep-water currents to rise up when they hit the bank. This brings
        nutrients and minerals up from the bottom of the ocean and feeds the
        entire marine ecosystem. Over 130 species call the bank home at some
        point throughout the year, and mong these is the Atlantic bluefin tuna.
        These fish migrate to the bank every year due to its reliable source of
        food for them, which makes this one of the most productive fishing spots
        for the species.
      </p>
      <h3>When</h3>
      <p>
        Typically, bluefin tuna begin to arrive in the coastal waters of New
        England around early June. At this point in the year, these fish are
        still completing their migration north and often do not settle into
        particular areas for long periods of time, making them more difficult to
        hook. It isn't until around the middle of July when the fish begin to
        settle in in large numbers. The peak months for bluefin tuna fishing are
        August through September and sometimes even October. At this time of
        year, these fish are focused on feeding as much as possible before they
        begin their migration back down south. And despite colder water
        temperatures, there are still some tuna around in November and December
        as well.

      <h3>How to Find Bluefin Tuna</h3>
      <img
        id="map"
        src="project/images/tunafishingspots.jpg"
        alt="spots"
        title="Cape Cod Bay Fishing Spots"
        width="400"
      />
      <p>
        How you choose to seach for your exact fishing spot will depend on the
        type of fishing you will be doing, which will be covered in more detail
        on the <a href="techniques.html">Techniques</a> page. The biggest factor
        in finding bluefin tuna is finding forage. Wherever there are large
        amounts of bait fish, the bluefin will not be far behind. During the
        summer months, there is almost always large amounts of baitfish
        (herring, mackerel, menhaden and sand eels) present around the edges of
        Stellwagen Bank. Many bluefin are caught every year along the western
        edge of the bank in 120-150 feet of water. In addition to having a good
        idea of where the bait is, sometimes there are more obvious signs of
        where the bait is. Signs such as birds diving into the water,
        disturbances or splashes on the surface of the water, and large amounts
        of whales in an area all indicate that bait is in the area and tuna are
        close by. It is always important to keep an eye out for these signs
        while out fishing.

      <h3>Other Spots to Find Bluefin Tuna</h3>
      <p>
        While Stellwagen Bank is one of the most popular spots to fish for
        bluefin tuna, there are many other spots within Cape Cod Bay that prove
        to be successful. The map above shows some of these locations. Move your
        mouse over the map to see where these locations in more detail. Click
