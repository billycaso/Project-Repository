    <div>
      <p>
        The amount of equipment required to successfully fish for bluefin tuna
        can be overwhelming. This page will try and break down all the different
        types of gear, both boating related and fishing related, in the easiest
        way possible. For boating equipment, this page will stick to aspects of
        the boat that pertain to this type of fishing and will avoid covering
        basic boating safety equipment and the likes.

      <h2>Boating Equipment</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Boat</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The boat is obviously the most important piece to the puzzle when it
        comes to fishing offshore for anything. If you are lucky enough to live
        on the north or south shores of Massachusetts, it isn't a far ride out
        to where the tuna are and a very large boat isn't always necessary. A
        small to medium sized center console or walk around stye boat is often a
        big enough boat to safely make it out to Stellwagen Bank and back. These
        boats are also perfect for recreational bluefin tuna fishing, and many
        saltwater fishermen have these types of boats to begin with. With a boat
        smaller than this, you may be limited in the days you can fish based on
        the weather and how windy it is. It is important to make some simple
        modifications and upgrades to your boat if you want to be a successful
        bluefin tuna fisherman.

    <div>
      <h3>Livewell</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        A livewell is a small tank that pumps fresh seawater in and out with the
        purpose of keeping small fish alive to be used as bait. This is an
        important aspect of tuna fishing when it comes to live bait fishing.
        Most center console boats have livewells built in already, however small
        portable livewells are simple to construct on your own if your boat does
        not have one.

    <div>
      <h3>Navigation and Sonar</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        When most fishermen buy a boat, they will outfit with marine
        electronics. A navigation unit and sonar unit are extremely important
        when fishing and often times can be bought on one machine. The
        navigation unit, or chart plotter is an extremely important tool while
        fishing. The chart plotter will tell you the depths of the ocean over
        large areas, as well as show contour lines of the bottom. In addition,
        you can mark and save locations on the chart itself, so when you find or
        know of a good spot you will know exactly where it is and be able to
        drive right up to it. The sonar, also called a fish finder, is another
        very important tool while fishing. The fish finder is basically
        underwater radar and will show you in real time what is underneath your
        boat. This will provide a lot of information such as where the bait is
        and what depth the tuna are at as they swim by. It is also important
        when trying to fish on the edge of structure such as Stellwagen Bank so
        you can make sure you are positioned correctly on the slobe of the bank.

      <h3>The Anchor</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Anchoring is a big aspect of fishing for bluefin tuna in the northeast.
        Around Cape Cod and especially on Stellwagen Bank, anchoring up and
        using what is referred to as a "ball" is one of the most popular ways to
        fish. For this, you will need the actual anchor, which most likely comes
        with the boat, at least 600 feet of rope, about 100 feet of floating
        rope, and an anchor ball with a retrieving system. The purpose of the
        retrieving system is to be able to easily get the anchor back up to the
        boat without pulling it in by hand. The
        <a href="techniques.html">Techniques</a> page will cover how to set up
        with the anchor and use the retrieving system.

      <h3>Rod Holders</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        While bluefin tuna fishing, leaving the rod in the rod holder is the
        most popular way to fish. In order to do this successfully, you must
        have swivel base rod holders on your boat. A swivel base rod holder
        allows the rod to freely rotate back and forth in the holder as the fish
        is swimming around. Most boats do not come with these specialty rod
        holders installed so you may need to replace the stock rod holders or
        drill new holes in the gunwhale of the boat to istall them. There are a
        few different companies that make these rod holders including

      <h2>Fishing Equipment</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Reels</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The fishing reels used for bluefin tuna fishing are conventional reels
        in the 80 and 130 class. (An 80 class reel means the reel is rated to
        hold about 1,000 yards of 80 pound test monofilament line.) These reels
        are used because of their large line capacity and heavy drags. If you
        are just starting out in bluefin fishing, an 80 class reel will be
        sufficient. There are a few major brands that make these reels and all
        of them are very similar in performance as well as price, so it comes
        down to personal preference when choosing which one to buy. The
        <a href="https://www.tackledirect.com/ti80wa.html"
          >Tiagra 80 wide reel</a
        >
        made by Shimano is probably the most popular on the market. Other
        companies like Penn and Okuma make very similar reels as well. See the
        table below that compares the line capacity, drag pressure, and price of
        three of the most popular reels.

        These reels can last a lifetime if taken care of properly. You can
        easily find used reels in great condition on Ebay for a much lower
        price. Now that we have covered the reel, we have to fill it with
        fishing line. The goal with this type of fishing is to use fishing line
        with a high breaking strength and still be able to fit a lot of line on
        the reel. To accomplish this, 130lb hollow core braided fishing line is
        used. About 2/3 of the reel is filled with this, and the rest of the
        reel is filled with a topshot of 150-200lb monofilament. It is very
        important to pack the line on the reel extremely tight so it won't cut
        into itself when heavy tension is applied. If you take your reel to a
        local tackle shop, they should be able to spool it for you with the line
        you want.

      <h3>The Rod</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The fishing rods used for bluefin tuna fishing are very unique to this
        type of fishing and are often custom built. These rods are built on 7 or
        8 foot 130 class blanks with bent butts and large roller guides. The
        reason the rod has a bent butt is because it will be fished out of the
        swivel base rod holders on the boat, so the rod will always be pointed
        at an angle rather than stright up and down. The rod must have the large
        roller guides in order to reduce friction on the line and be able to fit
        terminal gear such as swivels and rubber bands through the guides. One
        company that makes great fishing rods is
        <a href="https://reeleasyinc.com/product/trident-80130-2/"
          >Reel Easy Custom Rods</a
        >. Some local big game tackle shops will build these types of rods as
        well. From a small to medium sized boat, it is hard to fish more than 2
        rods at once, so buying to rods and reels to go with them will be good.

      <h3>Terminal Gear</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The subject of terminal gear is probably the most personal and unique
        when it comes to tuna anglers. Terminal gear includes the hooks, leader,
        swivels and crimps. For the hooks, many people use large 9/0 or 10/0
        circle hooks. Circle hooks are a great choice for recreational anglers
        because the fish will almost always get hooked in the corner of the
        mouth and will never be gut hooked. For leaders, flourocarbon line is a
        must and there are two main reasons for this. While monofilament line
        will reflect light underwater, flourocarbon is almost invisible in the
        water so fish will not be able to see it as well. Also, flourocarbon is
        more abrasion resistant than monofilament so the tuna's small teeth will
        not e able to bite through it. Using a relatively light pound test
        leader (150-180lb) is common to reduce the likelyhood of fish being able
        to see the line. Lastly, you will need swivels and crimps to attach the
        flourocarbon leader to your main line and your hook to your leader.
        Before making your leaders, it is a good idea to color all of the
        swivels, crimps and hooks with a black sharpie so they don't shine
        underwater.

        Other fishing gear you will need includes large bank sinkers, different
        colored balloons (bio degradable), and rubber bands.
