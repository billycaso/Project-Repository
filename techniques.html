      <h1>Techniques</h1>
      <p>
        Now that the general informtion regarding the blufin tuna fishery and
        the equipment required for it has been covered, it's time to put all
        these pieces together and discuss how to actually fish for these
        incredible fish. Everything from finding a spot, anchoring up, catching
        bait, setting lines and fighting the fish will be discussed here. This
        page will take you chronologically through what a day of bluefin tuna
        fishing might look like.
      </p>
      <h3>Finding a Spot to Fish and Anchoring</h3>
      <img

        alt="swcorner"
        title="Stellwagen Bank Southwest Corner"
        width="400"
      />
      <p>
        Finding the right spot to fish is definitely the most critical part of
        the equation. Obviously, fishing where there are no fish will prove to
        be unsuccessful. As previously mentioned, Stellwagen Bank is a very
        popular area to fish for bluefin tuna throughout the entirety of the
        season. As is true with fishing for many other types of fish, finding
        structure underwater can usually be a productive spot to fish.
        Stellwagen Bank itself is a large area with many different locations to
        fish at, but the western edge of the bank, and specifically the
        southwest corner, is the most popular spot on the bank because of the
        structure of the sea floor and the drastic changes in water depth. At
        the southwest corner of the bank, the water depth goes from about 200
        feet up to 70 feet within about 100 yards.
      </p>
      <img
        src="project/images/anchored.jpg"
        alt="anchored"
        title="A Boat Anchored Up On the Ball"
        width="400"
      />
      <p>
        So let's say you've decided to fish at the southwest corner of
        Stellwagen Bank. You know there is bait in the area and the possibility
        of bluefin tuna swimming close by as well. Now it's time to find your
        own spot and anchor up to start fishing. Because Stellwagen Bank is such
        a popular location, there is often a large number of boats fishing there
        most days, especially on weekends, and unless you head out early and get
        there by 4 or 5 in the morning, there may already be as many as 30 boats
        within a few mile radius. If you're one of the first boats there, you
        can anchor wherever you want. However, if there are already multiple
        boats anchored up already, it's important to stay at least a half mile
        away from other boats. The reason for this is because bluefin tuna are
        extremely fast swimmers. If one is hooked in the middle of a bunch of
        boats right next to eachother, it will surely find an anchor line to
        swim around which will most likely break the fishing line. Once you have
        found a spot that is on the edge of the bank (120-150 feet deep) and you
        are far enough away from other fishing boats, it's time to drop the
        anchor. First, you should drive the boat a little bit up current of the
        exact spot you want to be over to account for the scope of the anchor
        line. Then you can toss the anchor off the front of the boat. The amount
        of anchor line you let out should be at least 3 times the water depth
        (if you are in 150 feet of water you should use at least 450 feet of
        anchor line) in order for the anchor to dig into the ground enough. Once
        you've done that, you can take the poly ball from the anchor retrieval
        system and tie it directly to the end of the anchor line and tie your
        floating polypropalene line to the poly ball as well. The purpose of the
        poly ball is to keep the end of your anchor line at the surface so you
        can easily detach from the anchor when hooked up to a fish and easily
        come back to pick it up. The purpose of the floating line is to put
        separation between your boat and the anchor line underwater so a bluefin
        tuna can't swim directly into it once hooked. Letting out 50 to 100 feet
        of the floating tag line is sufficient, and you can tie it off at the
        bow and get ready to start fishing.

      <h3>Catching Bait</h3>
      <img

        alt="bait"
        title="Catching Bait with a Sabiki Rig"
        width="150"
      />
      <p>
        Now that you're anchored in your spot, its time to start fishing for
        bait to put in the livewell. Many inshore anglers are familiar with
        catching baitfish using a sabiki rig. The same technique for catching
        baitfish applies here as well. You should keep an eye on your fish
        finder for balls of baitfish swimming under your boat and at what depths
        they are at. Baitfish such as mackerel, herring, whiting and squid can
        all be caught at Stellwagen Bank and all make great live baits for
        bluefin tuna. Once you catch the first baitfish you can begin setting
        out your tuna lines, but you should be periodically fishing for baitfish
        throughout the day to eep the livewell full incase you want to switch
        the baits out.
      </p>
      <h3>Setting Lines</h3>
      <img
        src="project/images/tether.jpg"
        alt="tether"
        title="Rubber Band Tether"
        width="300"
      />
      <p>
        Now that you have live baits, it's time to put them on hooks and let
        them swim. Assumig you have two setups to fish with, you will be setting
        the two baits you put out at different depths to cover more of the water
        column. Bank sinkers and balloons are used in order to control the depth
        that the baits sit at. But first you need to bait your hooks. There are
        many different ways of doing this, but one of the most simple and
        effective ways to hook your live bait in the back just in front of the
        dorsal fin. Once youv'e but a bait on the first hook, you can toss it in
        the water and let it swim. The first line you set out will be farthest
        from the boat and closest to the surface. So for this bait, pull some
        line off the reel and tie a brightly colored balloon to the line about
        30 or so feet from the hook. This will ensure that when you continue to
        let line off the reel, the bait will be suspended 30 feet underwater.
        The balloon will also be an indication of when you get a bite because
        the balloon will be pulled underwater. You should continue to let the
        current carry the balloon until it is about 100 feet away from the boat.
        For the second bait, you can hook it exactly the same as the first and
        try to set it so the bait is suspended at about 2/3 of the depth of the
        water you are in. So if it is 120 feet deep, you should try and set the
        bait at about 80 feet. The depth of this bait will not be controlled
        with a balloon. Instead you will use a lead sinker and let the line sit
        vertically from the rod tip directly under the boat. You should tie the
        lead sinker to the line about halfway to the hook, so if you want to set
        the bait at 80 feet deep, tie the sinker 40 feet up from the hook. If
        you tie the sinker too close to the hook, a tuna might see it and be
        spooked off. Also the natural tendancy of the baitfish will be to swim
        down in the water. After you tie the sinker on, pull off another 40 feet
        of line so the hooked bait is suspended 80 feet deep. Now, using a
        rubber band, take the line about 5 feet from the tip of the rod and
        tether it to the handle of the reel. Using a rubber band as a tether
        acts as a shock absorber so as the boat rocks back and forth over waves,
        your bait won't be bouncing up and down as well. You will also hear the
        rubber band snap if you get a bite. Now that you've set your baits out,
        be patient and wait for a bite! It is a good idea to check your baits
        every hour or so to make sure they are still lively and switch them out
        if necessary. Also, keep an eye on your fish finder for tuna swimming
        underneath to see what depths they are at so you can adjust your baits
        accordingly.

      <h3>Fighting the Fish</h3>
      <p>
        If you do eventually get a bluefin tuna to eat one of your baits, you
        will most certainly know when it happens. Either the balloon will
        disappear under the water or the rubber band will snap and line will
        start peeling off your reel. This is when it becomes extremely helpful
        to have at least two people on the bat. When this happens, go to the rod
        that got bit and try and make a couple of cranks on the reel to make
        sure the line is tight and has no slack in it. More often than not, the
        tuna will continue to take line off the reel for a solid 30 to 45
        seconds without stopping. While this is going on, the other person on
        the boat should be reeling in the other line, starting the boat engine,
        and releasing the anchor line. Once all that has been done, and
        hopefully the fish is swimming away from your anchor line and towards
        open water, you can start slowly chasing the fish down with your boat to
        gain a lot of line back on the reel quickly. Always remember to keep the
        line tight and the rod should always have a bend in it. If there is any
        slack in the line, the hook could come loose. Depending on the size of
        the fish, the fight could last anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours.
        Once the long battle is over and the fish is alongside the boat,
        assuming you are going to release, it is important to make sure the fish
        is not too fatigued so it can swim away safely. If the fish is still
        swiming strong, you can reach over and cut the line as closely to the
        hook as you can, which will fall out soon. However, if the fish is very
        slow and fatigued, you must help to revive the fish by holding the
        leader in your hands and having someone else but the boat in gear to
        slowly tow the fish. This will help to break up all the lactic acid that
        has built up in the fish from fighting so hard. As soon as the tuna
        starts begins to out swim the boat, it is healthy enough to release and
        you can cut the line.

      <h3>Retrieving the Anchor</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of your fishing trip, you have to pick up your anchor before
        leaving. The anchor retrieval system makes this process extremely easy.
        Here is a video of someone demonstrating how the system works and how easy it is to
        use:

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Hopefully this information is a good jumping off point to get started in
        bluefin tuna fishing. As you spend more time on the water, you will
        learn a lot more like different spots, fishing techniques, and what
        works best for you on your boat. And remember that patience is key. This
        is arguably one of the most difficult fish to catch in the world, so
        don't get discouraged if it takes a while before you hook your first
        bluefin. If you would like to ask us any questions or provide us
